<p>However, most whey isolates used in the big name brands are only 80% protein by weight, or are a blend of 80% and 90% to add to their bottom line.&amp;nbsp; I am sure you can figure out that the amount of 90% whey is minimal in such blends...</p>

<p>While this is technically a more expensive procedure, it yields the highest percentage of protein by weight as well as small particle peptides that are rapidly absorbed into the blood stream.&amp;nbsp; Given these facts, plus the fact that whey isolate has little-to-no cholesterol or carbs, our whey isolate is an excellent choice for getting shredded!</p>
