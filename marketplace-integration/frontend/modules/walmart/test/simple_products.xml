<p>However, most whey isolates used in the big name brands are only 80% protein by weight, or are a blend of 80% and 90% to add to their bottom line.&amp;nbsp; I am sure you can figure out that the amount of 90% whey is minimal in such blends...</p>

<p>While this is technically a more expensive procedure, it yields the highest percentage of protein by weight as well as small particle peptides that are rapidly absorbed into the blood stream.&amp;nbsp; Given these facts, plus the fact that whey isolate has little-to-no cholesterol or carbs, our whey isolate is an excellent choice for getting shredded!</p>

            <shortDescription><![CDATA[<p>Although there are other forms of protein derived from dairy processing such as caseinate, whey is the most commonly used protein in sports nutrition.&amp;nbsp; Whey is found in either concentrate or isolate form. The difference between the two consisting in the amount of protein by weight...&amp;nbsp; While whey concentrate contains only 48% - 89% protein by weight, whey isolate can contain 90%+ protein by weight depending on the extraction methods used, quality of livestock, etc.</p>

<p>However, most whey isolates used in the big name brands are only 80% protein by weight, or are a blend of 80% and 90% to add to their bottom line.&amp;nbsp; I am sure you can figure out that the amount of 90% whey is minimal in such blends...</p>

<p>New World Nutritionals is one of the biggest purchasers of whey protein in the USA and supplies most of the companies whose products you see on the shelves in stores.&amp;nbsp; This is why we don't need to sell anything but the best in order to turn a profit!&amp;nbsp; Our bulk whey protein is sourced from the highest quality livestock available before being put through a cross-flow micro filtration process.</p>

<p>While this is technically a more expensive procedure, it yields the highest percentage of protein by weight as well as small particle peptides that are rapidly absorbed into the blood stream.&amp;nbsp; Given these facts, plus the fact that whey isolate has little-to-no cholesterol or carbs, our whey isolate is an excellent choice for getting shredded!</p>
