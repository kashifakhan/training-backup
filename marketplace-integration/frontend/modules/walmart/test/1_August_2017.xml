<p>While this is technically a more expensive procedure, it yields the highest percentage of protein by weight as well as small particle peptides that are rapidly absorbed into the blood stream.&amp;nbsp; Given these facts, plus the fact that whey isolate has little-to-no cholesterol or carbs, our whey isolate is an excellent choice for getting shredded!</p>
