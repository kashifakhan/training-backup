PHP >= 5.3.9

This plugin integrates [Composer] with the [Puli Manager]. Whenever you install 
or update your Composer dependencies, a [Puli resource repository] and 
[discovery] are built from the puli.json files of all installed packages:

```json
{
    "path-mappings": {
        "/acme/blog": "resources"
    }
}
```

You can load the built repository/discovery in your code:

```php
$factoryClass = PULI_FACTORY_CLASS;
$factory = new $factoryClass();

// Fetch resources from the repository
$repo = $factory->createRepository();

echo $repo->get('/acme/blog/config/config.yml')->getBody();

// Find resources by binding type
$discovery = $factory->createFactory($repo);

foreach ($discovery->findBindings('doctrine/xml-mapping') as $binding) {
    foreach ($binding->getResources() as $resource) {
        // do something...
    }
}
```
